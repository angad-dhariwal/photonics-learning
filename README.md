# photonics-learning

This repo's purpose is to document my journey in learning more about photonics, especially with MIT Electromagnetic Equation Propagation (MEEP), which is a finite-difference time-domain method to solve Maxwell's equations. It is very powerful and allows one to simulate many different electromagnetic phenomena.

Specifically, I use PyMeep, which is a library that allows MEEP to run with familiar python.

I beginned with reviewing Maxwell's equations, getting familiar with them in all forms. I then went through a few tutorials available on the [MEEP documentation](https://meep.readthedocs.io/en/latest/Python_Tutorials/Basics/#).
